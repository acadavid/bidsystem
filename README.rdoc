== Bid System

Live demo: http://bidsystem.herokuapp.com/

This app is an extension of an exercise i was asked to do. I was asked to do an API for a Bid system but with certain constrains and an API definition. I modified the API to meet my needs and implemented a front-end using Backbone.js to learn the technology.

The system has no authentication, it just "login" a user, meaning that it scopes the action to that given user.
